# Code Modernization by Amazon Q

This repository contains Python code that has been modernized by Amazon Q. The modernization process focused on updating Python 2 style code to modern Python 3 standards.

## Files

- `original_code.py`: The original Python code with Python 2 syntax and practices
- `modernized_code.py`: The modernized version with Python 3 syntax and best practices
- `sales.csv`: Sample data file used by the code

## Modernization Changes

1. **File Handling**:
   - Updated from binary mode to text mode with proper newline handling
   - Added context managers (`with` statements) for proper resource management

2. **Code Style**:
   - Updated print statements to Python 3 syntax
   - Replaced manual loops with list comprehensions where appropriate

3. **Type Annotations**:
   - Added type hints throughout the code
   - Included return type annotations for all functions

4. **Documentation**:
   - Added docstrings to all functions

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
   - Used more efficient list operations

## Running the Code

Both versions of the code can be run with Python, but the original code requires Python 2 while the modernized code requires Python 3:

```bash
# For the original code (Python 2)
python original_code.py

# For the modernized code (Python 3)
python3 modernized_code.py
```

Both scripts will read the `sales.csv` file and filter for items in the "Books" category.
